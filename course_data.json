  "course_name": "The DevOps Toolkit: Kubernetes Chaos Engineering - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "Letâ€™s face it, bad things happen in software engineering, often when you least expect it. Servers go down, there are spikes in traffic, you receive networking errors. Luckily, you can avoid these problems. Enter chaos engineering.\nChaos engineering is where you try to find the limits of a system and simulate adverse effects that might happen. These simulations then help you to determine the best way to improve your system and build up its resiliency.\nThis course is divided into various sections to get you used to the different types of experiments you can run in chaos engineering. You will start by learning how to destroy application instances in order to show you the importance of scaling, fault tolerance, and high availability.\nYou will then dive deep into other types of experiments such as destroying a network, draining and deleting nodes, and testing availability. Towards the end of the course, you will learn how to run experiments in a Kubernetes cluster.",
